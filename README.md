# RST-Controller-Code-Generator-Simulator
The main objective of this research is to build (.exe &amp; installer) app which can simulate “a plant with its disturbances” controlled by RST Digital Controller. 

In this research, MATLAB GUI and functions are used to convert the plant from continuous to discrete and tune the RST controller parameters to get the target characteristics desired to the system &amp; also to simulate the process.

The presented app can generate the system &amp; RST parameters on .h files. generation of C code is also supported by this app, which can run on Tiva C ARM-CORTEX M4.
