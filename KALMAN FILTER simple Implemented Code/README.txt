# SFND_Unscented_Kalman_Filter
Sensor Fusion UKF Highway Project Starter Code

In this project you will implement an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of multiple cars on a highway using noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

The main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ukf_highway
